# TABGxGUI

Welcome to the TABGxGUI branch.

Using the TABGxGUI mod, you will be able to run custom servers for your friends with ease.

## Using this project

Getting started is simple. Just follow these steps:
1. Download the client patcher from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JIBSIL/TABGCommunityServer/releases). It should be called "extractor.exe"
2. Follow the steps in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWdDRf7fquU

## Building

If you'd rather not trust unsigned binaries from this repository, you may build them yourself.

## Chat Commands:

The following commands can be typed in chat:
* `/kill victimid killerid victimname` (for example: `/kill 0 0 PLAYERNAME`)
* `/give itemid itemamount` (for example: `/give 123 1` NOTE: you have to add the quantity at the end of the command otherwise you will not receive the item)
* `/notification`
* `/kit`
* `/coords`
* `/broadcast MESSAGE`
* `/revive`
* `/heal`
* `/state PLAYERSTATE`
* `/gamestate flying/waiting/started/countdown` (countdown has an integer argument of how many seconds to count down)

## FAQ:

**Is this illegal? Do you use Landfall's copyrighted code in the server?**
Not in the US, and no. This is built from the ground up with zero Landfall code. We did not use leaks or any other non-public information to build the server.

**How does this compare to the regular server?**
The regular server is built in Unity, and is quite a bit more inefficient than this one. This software has been built specifically for performance on large player counts.

## Server Lists
An official server list hosted by ObitMC will be live this week.
